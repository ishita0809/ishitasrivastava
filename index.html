    Wildlife populations depend on their environment or habitat to receive
    the basic needs for survival. An ecosystem or habitat provides populations
    of wildlife with food, water, shelter and space. If all four of these basic
    needs are not available in a suitable arrangement, populations of wildlife can not exist.
    All populations of living things are interrelated.When one population
    of animals, plants, or insects increase or decrease, other populations of living things
    are also affected.For example, when shrubs and brushy areas are removed from an ecosystem,
    the rabbit population will likely go down. The reduced rabbit population will
    lower predator populations that use rabbits as a food source.
    To hunters, anglers, hikers, birders,wildlife watchers, boaters, climbers, campers, cyclists, gardeners, farmers,
    forest stewards, and other outdoor enthusiasts, this conservation ethic represents
    a sacred duty and obligation to protect and build upon our conservation heritage
    for the sake of wildlife, ourselves, our neighbors, and—most of all—for future
    generations.
    The amount of suitable habitat for a species of wildlife will determine the number of
    animals that can survive in the area. Human activity has the greatest impact on the amount and quality of
    wildlife habitat in Illinois. Wildlife habitat can be destroyed or its quality diminished
    as a result of urban sprawl, agricultural practices, pollution, sedimentation, or habitat
    fragmentation.People can also have a positive impact on wildlife populations through
    improvement and protection of habitat or ecosystems. The planting of trees and shrubs,
    as well as wildlife food plots, in the appropriate locations is one way landowners can
    improve wildlife habitat. People can protect ponds, streams, rivers and wetlands from
    sedimentation by reducing soil erosion on lands surrounding these aquatic ecosystems.
    Nesting boxes placed in ecosystems that lack dead, hollow trees will enhance the habitat
    for cavity nesting animals. There are many things people can do to improve habitat for
    wildlife.There are a number of natural resource management agencies in Illinois that
    can help people enhance and protect wildlife habitat. Listed below are a few of the
    public agencies which can provide ecosystem management expertise to people in Illinois.

        <p class="lead text-dark">National park is an area which is strictly reserved for 
          the betterment of the wildlife and biodiversity, and where activities like developmental,
           forestry, poaching, hunting and grazing on cultivation are not permitted. 
           The government can declare an area as a national park with adequate ecological,
            geo-morphological and natural significance. In these parks, even private ownership 
            rights are not allowed. Their boundaries are well marked and circumscribed. 
            They are usually small reserves spreading in an area of 100 sq. km. to 500 sq. km. 
            In national parks, the emphasis is on the preservation of a single floral or fauna species. Thanks to India’s biodiversity, there is at least
           one national park in each state that displays vivid flora and fauna of the region.
           National Parks in India are discussed here along with the Wildlife Sanctuaries.
            These are the suitable place for biodiversity conservation. National Parks and
             Wildlife Sanctuaries are protected areas declared by Government 
             with the primary objective to preserve wildlife, save flora & fauna and
             restore the natural ecological balance. There are 103 National Parks and 544 Wildlife Sanctuaries in India. Madhya Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar Islands have the maximum number of National Parks (9 each). The spectacular natural 
           beauty across the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in India attracts millions of tourists every year.</p>
